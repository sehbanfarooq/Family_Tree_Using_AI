Open VS Code
Create new project as Famiy_Tree_Using_AI
Open terminal and see if the path is the right folder example "PS C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\Family_Tree_Using_AI>"
If the path is correct write the following commands to create the virtual environment for our project---
     -> python -m venv venv
     -> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
     -> venv\Scripts\activate
After writing the following commands you will see the path as "(venv) PS C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\Family_Tree_Using_AI". If the (venv) appears at the beginning of the path then virtual environment is created.
Now wite the command 
    -> pip install flask
    -> pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy
Now copy the files in the folder as shown. 
Hope you got the output.
